## Course Description
This course is at the intersection of computer science and engineering. It provides both theory and hands-on experience with the development of large-scale software systems. You will learn systematic methods for large-scale software development including: agile process, software analysis, architecture patterns, design patterns, code generation, unit testing, regression testing, bug finding, code refactoring and DevOps. You will get to practice these methods in the context of a software project developed in collaboration with other students. However, this course will not focus on coding; and students are expected to already have basic knowledge of Java, which will be used for basic coding exercises and to demonstrate coding examples.

## Course Survey
In the first lecture, I will ask you to fill out a background survey on your background and what you are hoping to learn. In the second lecture, I will discuss how your expectations are aligned with and/or different from what is to be covered and emphasized in the course.

## Grades
Participation: 5%

Homework: 20%

## Participation
You are expected to attend and participate in all lecture and discussion sessions of this class. Participation will be measured by answering quizzes posted during class on Google forms. You will be allowed to miss up to 10% of the quizzes. This should allow you to address circumstances like being sick, having schedule conflicts, etc. without losing marks. So, plan accordingly, and do not ask your instructor or TA for make ups.

## Homework
You will be given homeworks in this class with questions that are representative of those you will get on tests. Homework is individual (no team) effort (zero tolerance for collaboration). You should plan to submit them by the due date. Late submission may be allowed with a penalty on some homeworks.

## Exams
You will write two exams in this class. The first is a Midterm that is given in week 6. The second is a Final that is given in week 11 (the finals week). Exams are always an individual (not team) effort (zero tolerance for any kind of collaboration).

## Project
You will practice the software engineering process and methods that you learn in class to develop a software application as an open-source project on Github. The project will be carried by a team of 5-6 students (you will form such a team in the first week). 

You will have the opportunity to propose your own unique app idea (web app, mobile app or desktop app) that can be developed in 8 weeks. You will have the freedom to choose a programming language and a technology stack to realize your app. Hence, it would be prudent to choose ones that team members already have expertise with or can manage to learn within this timeframe.

You are expected to showcase your project work incrementally over time through a set of deliverables (shown below). You will also be asked to present those deliverables, as well as provide constructive feedback on other teams’ deliverables.

Your TAs will be in charge of setting expectations for and grading your project deliverables. The focus will be on the quality of following the development process, using the methods taught in class, and justifying/communicating your decisions (not on making the app have the most features, the hottest UI or the trendiest tech stack). Students in the same team may not always receive the same grade, as TAs will consider your individual contribution/effort and your teammates' feedback when giving individual grades.

## Project deliverables:
Part A: Application Concept, Epics, Feasibility, and Technology Stack (3%)

Part B: Application Analysis, Architecture and Design Descriptions (11%)

Part C: Application Realization, Testing, Integration, and Deployment (11%)

Part D: Application Demonstration (Youtube video) and Project Retrospective (5%)

## Platforms
We will be using *Bruin Learn* as the main platform for posting the lecture and discussion material and making announcements so make sure to check it regularly. We will also use the *Zoom* platform to run the lecture and discussion sessions in the scheduled times for remote sessions. Those sessions will also be recorded so you can rewatch them at any time. We will be using *Gradescope* to receive your homework and exam grades. We will also be submitting your project deliverables through it ( one submission per team suffices). We will also be using the *Piazza* platform for discussions, Q/A and announcements. Finally, we will be using *Google Forms* for class quizzes and surveys.

## Feedback
At some points, we will be asking you to give feedback on your learning experience using anonymous surveys. It is very important for us to know your reaction to what we are doing in the class, so I encourage you to respond to the surveys, to help us create an environment that is effective for teaching and learning.

## Academic Integrity
Each student is expected to uphold the values of integrity, honesty, trust, fairness, and respect toward peers and community. Violations (e.g., cheating, unpermitted collaboration or use of resources) will absolutely NOT be tolerated. In your first week, you must read and sign UCLA's Academic Integrity Statement and submit it through Gradescope.

## Class Policies
- The instructor cannot accommodate individual requests to schedule the Midterm or Final exam on different dates.
- Grades for individual components will not be curved. However, the final grade may get adjusted using a curve before letter grades are assigned.
